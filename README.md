## News
:boom: Hiring research interns for visual tracking, segmentation and neural architecture search projects: houwen.peng@microsoft.com

:boom: We achieves the runner-ups for both [VOT2020ST (short-term) and RT(real-time)](http://data.votchallenge.net/vot2020/presentations/vot2020-st.pdf). The variants of Ocean take **2nd/3rd/5th** places of VOT2020RT. The [SiamDW-T](https://github.com/researchmm/VOT2019) submitted to VOT2019 achieves **1st** of [VOT2020RGBT](http://data.votchallenge.net/vot2020/presentations/vot2020-rgbt.pdf) (submitted by VOT committee).  

:boom: Our paper [Ocean](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10721v2.pdf) has been accepted by [ECCV2020](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/html/3872_ECCV_2020_paper.php). 

:boom:  The initial version is released, including [Ocean(ECCV2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10721v2.pdf) and [SiamDW(CVPR2019)](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhang_Deeper_and_Wider_Siamese_Networks_for_Real-Time_Visual_Tracking_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf).

:boom: We provide a TensorRT implementation, running at 1.5~2.5 times faster than pytorch version (e.g. 149fps/68fps for video `twinnings`, see [details](https://github.com/researchmm/TracKit/tree/master/lib/tutorial/)).

**Note:** We focus on providing an easy-to-follow code based on **Pytorch** and **TensorRT** for research on video object tracking and segmentation task. The code will be continuously optimized. You may pull requests to help us build this repo.

Official implementation of the Ocean tracker. Ocean proposes a general anchor-free based tracking framework. It includes a pixel-based anchor-free regression network to solve the weak rectification problem of RPN, and an object-aware classification network to learn robust target-related representation. Moreover, we introduce an effective multi-scale feature combination module to replace heavy result fusion mechanism in recent Siamese trackers. An additional **TensorRT** toy demo is provided in this repo.

### SiamDW
**[[Paper]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhang_Deeper_and_Wider_Siamese_Networks_for_Real-Time_Visual_Tracking_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) [[Raw Results]](https://github.com/researchmm/SiamDW) [[Training and Testing]](https://github.com/researchmm/TracKit/tree/master/lib/tutorial/SiamDW/siamdw.md) [[Demo]]()** <br/>
SiamDW is one of the pioneering work using deep backbone networks for Siamese tracking framework. Based on sufficient analysis on network depth, output size, receptive field and padding mode, we propose guidelines to build backbone networks for Siamese tracker. Several deeper and wider networks are built following the guidelines with the proposed CIR module.

### OceanPlus
**[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02745v2.pdf) [[Raw Results]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1doQiv82swum2rEXXo5C735WrLb_uAVbq?usp=sharing) [[Training and Testing Tutorial]](https://github.com/researchmm/TracKit/tree/master/lib/tutorial/OceanPlus/oceanplus.md) [[Demo]](https://github.com/researchmm/TracKit/tree/master/demo/oceanplus.gif)** <br/>
Official implementation of the OceanPlus tracker. It proposes an attention retrieval network (ARN) to perform soft spatial constraints on backbone features. Concretely, we first build a look-up-table (LUT) with the ground-truth mask in the starting frame, and then retrieve the LUT to obtain a target-aware attention map for suppressing the negative influence of pixel-wise background clutter. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-resolution multi-stage segmentation network (MMS) to ulteriorly weaken responses of background clutter by reusing the predicted mask to filter backbone features.
